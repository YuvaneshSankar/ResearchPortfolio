    "overview": "This project represents a cutting-edge approach to aerodynamic optimization in Formula 1, combining the global exploration capabilities of genetic algorithms with the adaptive learning power of reinforcement learning. The system optimizes multi-element F1 front wing configurations while ensuring strict compliance with FIA regulations.\n\nThe hybrid architecture leverages genetic algorithms for broad design space exploration, identifying promising wing geometries through evolutionary pressure. These solutions are then refined using reinforcement learning agents that learn optimal design modifications through interaction with computational fluid dynamics simulations.\n\nKey innovations include Bezier curve parameterization for smooth wing profiles, intelligent CFD scheduling that reduces computational overhead by 40%, and physics-informed reward structures that guide the RL agent toward aerodynamically sound solutions. The system achieves remarkable fitness scores of 60-80, representing significant improvements in downforce-to-drag ratios while maintaining regulatory compliance."

    "overview": "AlphaTacToe is a sophisticated tic-tac-toe playing agent inspired by the revolutionary AlphaZero algorithm. The system combines deep neural networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve superhuman performance through pure self-play learning, starting from random play with no human knowledge.\n\nThe architecture consists of a unified neural network that outputs both policy probabilities and value estimates for game positions. During training, the agent plays millions of games against itself, continuously improving its understanding of the game through reinforcement learning. The MCTS algorithm guides the search process, using the neural network to evaluate positions and select promising moves.\n\nImplementation highlights include efficient batched MCTS for parallel game simulation, advanced training techniques with experience replay, and sophisticated position encoding for the tic-tac-toe game state. The agent demonstrates emergent strategic understanding, developing complex opening strategies and endgame tactics purely through self-play."
